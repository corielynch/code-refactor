# first_homework

This is my first homework assignment, to make the repository more accessible.

The changes I made include:
-Added the title "Horiseon Management"
-Added comments in both HTML and CSS files
-Wrote descriptive alt attributes for all images
-Added HTML semantics to help organize sections, including replacing a div with an aside and section.
-Combined many redundant CSS features in the style.css
-Added spaces and indentation in HTML code to make it more readable
-Made sure the brackets opened and closed in a vertical line

I was unable to open the "hero" image for some reason, and I believe that affected some of the positioning, especially
for the aside. Other than that, I found this activity extremely useful even though I had to restart it again the day
it was due because of more complications opening/saving files. I am working to make that a more streamlined process.
